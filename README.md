I have learned with this proyect that css can be a pain in the ass. putting a grid with a color can be a good tool to debugg 
* {
    outline: 1px solid red;"
}
 
 i think that's all i have in mind for the crrent moment. If i figure other thinks that i have learned doing this little proyect with html and css i will put them right here!
